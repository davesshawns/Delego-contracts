//! Delego Permissions Contract
//! Spending limits, delegated authority, and time-locked allowance decrements
//!
//! # Error code allocation
//!
//! Numeric error codes are `u32` values surfaced over the bridge, so every
//! contract must own a disjoint numeric block. The current allocation is:
//!
//! | Contract          | Range      |
//! |-------------------|------------|
//! | `EscrowError`     | 1000-1999  |
//! | `PermissionError` | 2000-2999  |
//! | `ReputationError` | 3000-3999  |
//! | `DelegationError` | 4000-4999  |
//! | `MarketplaceError` | 5000-5999 |
//!
//! `PermissionError` keeps its historical status-code style by adding the
//! allocation base (`2000`) to each legacy value (e.g. `ParentNotFound`
//! moves from `404` to `2404`). The unit tests below enforce that every
//! `PermissionError` discriminant is inside the contract's range and that
//! the documented ranges are pairwise disjoint.

// Contract crates compile as no_std for release and wasm builds, but keep std
// enabled during testing so dev-dependencies and test assertions operate normally.
// This exact conditional form must be consistent across all workspace contract crates.
